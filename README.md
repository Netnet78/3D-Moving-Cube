# What is this all about? ‚ùî
**This is a small project about a spinning 3D cube in Python**\
Using python library called **Pygame** I manage to create a 3D cube while also refine it so that it would have some function to it.
The purpose of this project is that I wanted to learn about 3D spaces in the world of programming and also I wanted to improve my problem solving skills like math.
If you are interested in this small project feel free to contribute as much as you want and I would be thankful for all of you who contribute to this project.
