# Welcome to this repository! ðŸ‘‹
**If you want to contribute to this project then it's easy!**
1. To start off we are going to need a virtual environment, if you don't have one then you can do as the following:
  - Just copy and paste this command into the terminal:
  For virtual environment (.venv): `python -m venv myenv`
2. Then you need to install the *required* **dependencies**:
  - Copy and paste this to your terminal: `python -m venv myenv`
3. Run the command to use your virtual environment:
  - On Windows:
      `myenv\Scripts\activate`
  - On macOS/Linux:
      `source myenv/bin/activate`
4. Finally if you want to run the code just do the following:
  - In your terminal copy or write: `python main.py`

Anyways this is my first project on github so feel free to contribute and I will be making changes to this repository to keep you guys updated! ðŸ˜Š
